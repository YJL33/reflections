How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

I can reduce the debug area and just focus on the difference between two versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

I can restore the file to any prior version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros: Some changes are too trivial to create a commit, which can be made after major work are done.
Cons: It’s not automatically done.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Sometimes there are multiple changes in different files, but they are all made because of one reason. Git allows us to accumulate them into one single commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Use ‘git log’ to get history of files and each commit’s id, and then use ‘git diff’ to compare their difference.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Using version control makes people more confident while it keeps how things were before every change.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Try to push a project on Github.
