When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I need to work with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Since remote repository could be modified by other person rather than myself, which means that could be confusing.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are the behaviors of copying other people's repository into yours at Github.
  Clones are the behaviors of copying your own repository at either Github or local.
  Branches are making commits on other than master branch.
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
